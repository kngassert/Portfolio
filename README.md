Some past projects

GassertPosterSEDAAG.pdf: 
This poster shows the preliminary results of my Masters Thesis involving the convective mode climatology of tornadoes in Tennessee and its effect on the local National Weather Service office's warning and forecasting procedures. The poster won Best Graduate Poster at the regional SEDAAG (SouthEastern Division of the American Association of Geographers) Fall 2016 meeting.

Gassert_AGUpresentation.pdf:
This PDF accompanied my oral presentation given at the AGU (American Geophysical Union) Fall 2014 meeting. It showcased my undergraduate research work as a Climate Assessment Intern at the North Carolina Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites (CICS-NC), where I investigated rainfall correlation drop off rates across CONUS using gridded Stage IV radar data to determine sufficient coverage of GHCN-Daily in-situ gauges.
